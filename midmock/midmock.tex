\Problem `int *a[10];' declares a length-10 array of pointers to integers.
How to declare a pointer to an array of 10 integers?
\blank{int (*a)[10];}

\Problem What is the correct way to declare two pointers, both pointing to integers?
\no `int* a, b;`
\yes `int *a, *b;`
\no `&int a, b;`
\no `int &a, &b;`

\tikz [code block right] \node {
    int a = 10;
    int *p = &a;
    *p += 20;

};

\Problem
The code to the right outputs
\no `10'
\no `20'
\yes `200'

\hangindent-4cm \hangafter-2
\Problem Why is `malloc(100 * sizeof(int))' preferred over `malloc(400)'?
\no Because it is faster to avoid computer `sizeof(int)'.
\yes Because `int' may be 4 bytes on some machines but 8 bytes on others.
\no Because `sizeof(int)' is 8, so `400' is half of what we actually need.
\no Because `sizeof(int)' is 2, so `400' is twice of what is actually needed.

This is my first implementation that uses a second array `B'.
I want to achieve the same effect,
but without using extra memory (i.e., the second array `B').

With what parameters should I call it?
