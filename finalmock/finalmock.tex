\Problem{2em}
By default, struct members are
\no protected
\no private
\yes public
\no friend
~
\Problem{2em}
Define the default constructor that sets the age to `0'
and the name to `unnamed rabbit'.
~
\Problem{2em}
Define a constructor that sets the age to `0'
and the name to the argument.
~
\Problem{2em}
Define the getter function of `age'.
~
\Problem{2em}
Define the setter function `rename' that takes one string as argument;
if the string contains only `a'--`z' (all lowercase), then rename.
Otherwise return false.

\Problem{2em}
If `p1' is a pointer to a dog, how does `p1->age' work?
\no The compiler replaces it with `p1.(*age)'.
\no The runtime searches for `age' in the dictionary of of the dog.
\yes The compiler replaces it with `*(p1 + shift)' for some number `shift'.
~
\Problem{2em}
If the type of `p2' is pointer-to-dog, but it points to a chiwawa,
how does `p2->age' work?
\no The runtime cast `*p2' to a dog first and the problem reduces to the previous question.
\no The runtime searches for `age' in the dictionary of of the chiwawa.
\yes The compiler replaces it with `*(p2 + shift)' for the same `shift' as the last question.
\no The compiler replaces it with `*(p2 + shift)' for some different `shift'.
\no This does not work.
~
\Problem{2em}
If the type of `p3' is a pointer-to-chiwawa, but it points to a dog,
how does `p3->age' work?
\no This is not possible.
\no The runtime cast `*p3' to chiwawa using the default constructor.
\yes The compiler replaces it with `*(p3 + shift)' for the same number as the last question.
\no The compiler replaces it with `*(p3 + shift)' for some different number `shift'.
~
\Problem{2em}
If the type of `p4' is a pointer-to-dog, but it points to a chiwawa,
how does `p4->dB' work?
\no The runtime cast `p4' to pointer-to-chiwawa and perform `->dB'
\no The runtime searches for `dB' in the dictionary of of the chiwawa.
\no The compiler replaces it with `*(p4 + shift)' for some different number `shift'.
\yes This does not work.
~
\Problem{2em}
If you answer to the previous question implies that the compiler knows
that p4 points to a chiwawa, why does it know?
If your answer implies that the compiler does not know,
how to fix the code so that it knows?

\Problem{2em}
Which of the following are the benefit of using array of structures:
`Dog HuangBaBa[100]'?
\no Better cache locality when increasing all dogs' ages.
\yes Encapsulation and readable code: easy to pass `Dog*' to functions.
\yes Easier to sort dogs by age or name as we only modify one array.
\no Uses less memory because this avoids padding between two arrays.
~
\Problem{2em}
Which of the following is the benefit of using structures of arrays:
`int ages[100]; string names[100];'?
\yes Enables SIMD/vectorization for single-field operations.
\yes Uses less memory because this avoids padding between members.
\no Easier to sort dogs by age or name as we only modify one array.
\no Encapsulation and readable code: it suffices to pass index `i' to functions.

    int y = 2;

What is `f(g(2))'?
~
\Problem{2em}

\tikz [code block right] \node {
    auto pi = make_pair(3.14, "pi");
    auto e = make_pair(2.71, "e");
    auto [a, b] = pi;
    auto [c, d] = e;
};
\hangindent-\codewidth \hangafter-\codeheight
\Problem{2em}
Another way to obtain `a' is `auto a = pi.???;'
~
\Problem{2em}
Another way to obtain `b' is `auto b = pi.???;'
~
\Problem{2em}
The function template `make_pair' is defined in the standard library.
But how is it defined?
You may assume that the structure template `pair' is already defined.
You also don't need to worry about `const' or `&' (pass by reference thing).
~
\Problem{2em}
How to use `decltype' to make `DS' the type of `pi'?
~
\Problem{2em}
Overload the `+' operator for `DS' so that `pi + e' produces
`make_pair(5.85, "pi + e")'.

\tikz [code block right] \node {
    template<typename T>
    T sum(T one) \{ return one; \}

    \{ return first + sum(rest); \}
};
\hangindent-\codewidth \hangafter-\codeheight
\Problem{2em}
To the right is a usage of variadic template.
Use the similar style to define `apply' so that
`apply(x, f, g, h)' produces `h(g(f(x)))'.

\Problem{2em}
Let $t\sb0, t\sb1, t\sb2, \dotsc$ be the Thur--Morse sequence defined as:
\[
    t\sb0 = 0,\;
    t\sb{2n} = t\sb n,\;
    t\sb{2n+1} = 1 - t\sb n.
\]
Let `Car' be a class.
Overload the `+' operator for `queue<Car>' so that
the $j$th element of the `q1 + q2' is from
`q1' if $t\sb j = 0$ and from `q2' if $t\sb j = 1$.
Note that cars from the same queue should remain in the same order.

\Problem{2em}
For something like
`vector<vector<int>> VVI = \{ \{1,2,3\}, \{4,5\}, \{6\} \};'
how to sort it so that shorter vectors come first,
and for vectors of the same length, lower sum comes first,
and for vectors of the same length and sum, using dictionary order?

\Problem{2em}
Overload the `()' operator for `vector<T>' so that
`v(3)' returns `v[3]' and `v(-5)' returns `v[v.size() - 5]'.

\Problem{2em}
Overload the `[]' operator for `vector<T>' so that
`v[vector<int>{2, 4, 8}]' returns `vector<T>{v[2], v[4], v[8]}'.

\Problem{2em}
A Hamming codeword is an `array<bool, 127> x;' such that $x H = 0$,
where $H$ is the matrix where the $j$th row is the binary representation
of `j'; so the first row is `0000001' and the last row is `1111111'.
Given another `array<bool, 127> y', find the codeword `x'
that differs from `y' by at most one bit.
