    $\sin(\theta)$ is correct, $sin(theta)$ is not.

    $\atan(1/2)$ is correct, $\operatorname{atan}(1/2)$ is also correct.

    Around binary operator are 4mu spaces:
    $a + b$ is just ${a}\:{+}\:{b}$, which is like ${a}\mkern4mu{+}\mkern4mu{b}$.

    Around binary relation are 5mu space:
    $a = b$ is just ${a}\;{=}\;{b}$, which is like ${a}\mkern5mu{=}\mkern5mu{b}$.
